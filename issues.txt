Fix loading times !!!!!

BUGS:
   -- will not accept spaces [make like RiText.createWords]
   
   -- rotation problem ::  (all static rotations are upgFuct?)  ****
   
   -- frame-rate ***
   
   -- The "U" player gets caught in the platform/elevator, usually when the player has a bit more velocity going down [ABS]
   
   -- At large sizes the fonts don't seem to map well with the polygons (even at 100 detail level). For example,
      on the letterA board in my folder, the U overlaps with parts of the large E, and at other times it doesn't seem
      to be touching any part of the E. It works great in the debugging mode. It just seems like the letter E is not
      aligned with the polygons, but is offset from it a bit... [ABS]
   
   -- Debug mode: screen does not scroll [ABS]
   
   -- RECTS mode: Some rects around letters (in all CAPS) are taller than others so the player hits bumps trying to
      move smoothly over them. For example, the O seems to have a slightly higher RECT around it than other letters. [ABS]

FIXED:
   
NEXT: 
   -- add a bounding-box=per=word option for phrases/sentences
   
   -- add rect possibility for entire sentence, instead of individual rects for letters?  [DONE: DCH]
    
   -- experiment with sans-serif font performance
   
   -- add keybd (or other) controls for camera zoom/scroll
   
   -- toggle for debugDraw
   
   -- bigger screen 800x600 in walkthru (DONE: DCH)
   
   -- use pixel coordinates				 (DONE: DCH)  
   
   -- multi-letter polys in walkthru (DONE: DCH)
   
   -- RECTS are always Static? Can't seem to change them to be non-static. (FIXED: DCH)
   
   
** LevelEditor (2-way):
	-- drag/drop
	-- draw bounding-boxes
	-- assign properties
	-- see whole level (zoom/scroll)
   

  
Experiment with quotations and footnotes
